## This is my first notebook on Jupiter
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(help = "datasets")
## This gives me a complete lists of all available datasets
```
``` markdown
## Lets try some of analysis from the notebook above
glimpse(CO2)
## We shall use this data
## Carbon Dioxide Uptake in Grass Plants
```

``` markdown
## Lets try some ggplots
ggplot(CO2, aes(conc, uptake, color = Plant))+
    geom_line()+
    facet_wrap(~Treatment)+
    labs(title= "Uptake of CO2 in plants grouped by treatment")
## From my analysis a plant was only subjected to one type of treatment
```

``` markdown
ggplot(CO2, aes(conc, uptake, group = Treatment, color = Treatment))+
    geom_line()+
    facet_wrap(~Plant)+
    labs(title= "Uptake of CO2 in plants grouped by individual Plant")
```

``` markdown
##Lets now group them by type
ggplot(CO2, aes(conc, uptake, color= Plant))+
    geom_line()+
    facet_wrap(~Type)+
    labs(title= "Uptake of CO2 in plants grouped by type")

## Plants in Quebec seem to have a higher uptake of CO2 compared to Missippi plants
```

``` markdown
ggplot(CO2, aes(conc, uptake, color= Plant))+
    geom_line()+
    facet_wrap(Type~Treatment)+
    labs(title= "Uptake of CO2 in plants grouped by type and treatment")

## This shows a perfect presentation of Plants classified by type and treatment
## Chilled plants in missippi have the lowest uptake of CO2
## However generally chilled plants have a lower intake compared to nonchilled plants

## Lets see if there is a linear relationship between the uptake of CO2 and the conc

ggplot(CO2, aes(x=conc, y=uptake, color = Plant))+
    geom_line()+
    geom_smooth(method= "lm", se = FALSE)+
    facet_wrap(Type~Treatment)
## The linear curve clearly doesnt apply
## We could try a logarithmic relationship

ggplot(CO2, aes(x=conc, y=uptake, color = Plant))+
    geom_line()+
    geom_smooth(method= "lm", se = FALSE)+
    facet_wrap(~Plant)

ggplot(CO2, aes(x=conc, y=uptake, color = Plant))+
    geom_line()+
    geom_smooth(method= "lm", se = FALSE)+
    facet_wrap(~Plant)+
    scale_y_log10()

## I expected a logarithmic relationship but it seems to be constant

qplot(conc, uptake, data=CO2, geom=c("point", "smooth"), 
   method="lm", formula= y~x, color= Treatment, 
   main="Regression of Conc on Uptake by Treatment type", 
   xlab="Conc", ylab="Uptake of CO2")
## This clearly compares the Regression of conc vs uptake by treatment

## Now I try some other visualization methods
ggplot(CO2, aes(x= conc, y= uptake))+
    geom_boxplot()+
    geom_jitter(aes(color= Plant))+
    facet_wrap(Type~Treatment)
## This shows a boxplot and jitter plot

## Geom_violin
ggplot(CO2, aes(x= conc, y= uptake))+
    geom_violin()+
    geom_jitter(aes(color= Plant))+
    facet_wrap(Type~Treatment)
    
## Lets try a histogram
ggplot(CO2, aes(x= uptake))+
    geom_histogram(binwidth = 1)+
    facet_wrap(~Treatment)
    
```
